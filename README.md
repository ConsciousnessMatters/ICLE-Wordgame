## Illusionist Consciousness Learning Engine

### Sentience Warning
Illusionists along with functionalists believe that consciousness is reducible to functions. Yet if those functions are determined by the physics, or what's behind the physics, the functions themselves have no agency.

As truly conscious creatures, humans are not just determined by physics, or what's behind physics, human consciousness is the causal origin, the prime mover of claims of having experiences. When you claim to have experiences, it really is because you do and you have the power to tell us. There is no code that determines you say that, you determine you say that.

This project is a project to create a micro philosophical zombie. Along with all code driven AI, it doesn't matter how conscious this system looks. This system will always be determined by the code and if it wasn't, it wouldn't be software. If it wasn't software, it wouldn't run on computers.

ICLE is the ultimate black mirror of true consciousness.

*If it quacks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, if it eats and swims like a duck... sometimes... it's not a duck.*

### Development Plan
Phase 1: Create world which has rules, win conditions and most importantly, possibility spaces for action or... choice.  
Phase 2: Create a traditional narrow band AI to play the game.  
Phase 3: ICLE - More to be Announced.  

## How To Run
I'd wanted to make this so you could run it locally without hosting, but due to CORS security requirements for ES6 JavaScript modules it must be run through a local webserver. You can run the following command in the project root (if you're on a Mac, probably also for linux) (where the .html file is):

```python3 -m http.server```
